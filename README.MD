# Scratch CPU

## Im planning on recoding the assembler and documenting this within a few days

This is a Simple stack based CPU that I make on scratch with a fully fledged assembly language for.

Scratch Project:

## Assembling File
```
python assembler.py input.asm
// this outputs a input.txt file for scratch & the vm/emu
```

## Emulating the File
```
python emulator.py input.txt
// this opens the program in the emulator with the same capabilites as scratch, but faster
```
